Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions.

## Recent Focus (DOM Processor Implementation)

The primary focus has been implementing and testing the `DomProcessorService`. This involved:
*   Creating the service class responsible for capturing DOM state using `buildDomTree.js` via the `PlaywrightBridgeService`
*   Implementing the `buildDomTree.js` script based on browser-use functionality to capture DOM structure
*   Creating the data processing logic to transform raw browser DOM data into a structured `SerializableDOMNode` tree
*   Establishing a `SelectorMap` that maps interactive elements to their highlight indices
*   Implementing robust error handling, caching, and performance optimization for DOM processing
*   Creating comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Key Decisions & Changes

*   **DOM Processing Approach:** Implemented a two-pass approach for DOM tree construction - first parsing all nodes from the raw map, then linking children to parents in a second pass for better performance
*   **Performance Optimization:** Added caching mechanisms in `buildDomTree.js` to optimize expensive DOM operations like getBoundingClientRect and getComputedStyle
*   **Shift from MCP:** Decided to use direct Playwright integration via the `PlaywrightBridgeService` instead of the previously planned MCP-based approach, aiming for greater control and flexibility.
*   **Dependency Management:** Corrected the placement and versions of `playwright` and `@playwright/test` packages in `package.json` to ensure compatibility and proper production builds.

## Next Steps

1.  Implement the `PromptBuilderService` to format the DOM state for LLM interaction
2.  Implement the `ActionTranslatorService` to map `IntermediateStep` objects to calls on the `PlaywrightBridgeService`
3.  Integrate the `PlaywrightBridgeService` and `DomProcessorService` into the `ScenarioParserOrchestrator`'s main loop
