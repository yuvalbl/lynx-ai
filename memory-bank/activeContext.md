# Active Context

Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions.

## Recent Focus (Playwright Bridge)

The primary focus has been implementing and testing the `PlaywrightBridgeService`. This involved:
*   Creating the service class with core methods for browser lifecycle, navigation, DOM interaction (click, type, hover), and JS evaluation.
*   Establishing comprehensive unit tests with mocking.
*   Developing integration tests using real browser instances (initially headless, then configured for headed mode debugging).
*   Implementing robust error handling using a custom `PlaywrightBridgeError`.
*   Integrating a named logger (`winston`) for operation tracking.

## Key Decisions & Changes

*   **Shift from MCP:** Decided to use direct Playwright integration via the `PlaywrightBridgeService` instead of the previously planned MCP-based approach, aiming for greater control and flexibility.
*   **Dependency Management:** Corrected the placement and versions of `playwright` and `@playwright/test` packages in `package.json` to ensure compatibility and proper production builds.

## Next Steps

1.  Implement the `DomProcessorService` to capture DOM state using `buildDomTree.js` via the `PlaywrightBridgeService`.
2.  Implement the `ActionTranslatorService` to map `IntermediateStep` objects to calls on the `PlaywrightBridgeService`.
3.  Integrate the `PlaywrightBridgeService` into the `ScenarioParserOrchestrator`'s main loop.
