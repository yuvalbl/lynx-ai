# Active Context

Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions.

## Recent Focus (Task 5 Completion - LLM Integration)

The primary focus has been completing and validating the LLM interaction components:
*   **PromptBuilderService:** Complete implementation with browser-use inspired DOM formatting specifically optimized for test scenario generation
*   **NLToActionTranslatorLogic:** Multi-LLM provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) with LangChain function calling for structured IntermediateStep generation
*   **Template Architecture:** Separated system/user prompt templates optimized for test automation workflows
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and browser-use alignment tests achieving 95%+ coverage
*   **ScenarioInputValidator:** Input validation component for TestScenario objects with proper error handling

## Key Decisions & Changes

*   **Test Scenario Focus:** Aligned DOM formatting and prompts specifically for test automation rather than general web browsing, following browser-use patterns while maintaining independence
*   **Multi-LLM Architecture:** Implemented provider abstraction supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models with configurable parameters and API key management
*   **Function Calling Integration:** Used LangChain's function calling capabilities for structured IntermediateStep generation, ensuring consistent LLM output format
*   **Template-Based Prompts:** Separated system and user prompts for maintainability, allowing easy customization of test automation guidance
*   **Browser-Use Inspiration:** Adopted core DOM processing concepts while focusing specifically on test scenario generation needs
*   **Comprehensive Testing Strategy:** Implemented unit tests, integration tests, browser-use alignment tests, and real-flow demonstrations

## Current Status

**‚úÖ COMPLETED (Task 5):**
- PromptBuilderService with DOM formatting and prompt payload creation
- NLToActionTranslatorLogic with multi-LLM support and function calling
- Template system for system/user prompts
- Comprehensive test coverage including browser-use alignment validation
- ScenarioInputValidator for input validation

**üîç NEXT IMMEDIATE FOCUS (Task 5b):**
- LLM Integration validation with real API calls
- End-to-end prompt effectiveness testing
- Function calling reliability validation
- Confidence score measurement and optimization

## Next Steps

1.  **Task 5b (Immediate):** Validate LLM integration with real API calls and test scenarios
    *   Test OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google provider integrations
    *   Validate IntermediateStep generation quality and consistency
    *   Measure prompt effectiveness and confidence scores
    *   Test error handling with real LLM failure scenarios

2.  **Task 6 (Next Major):** Implement `ActionTranslatorService` to convert IntermediateStep to Playwright actions
    *   Map IntermediateStep objects to specific PlaywrightBridgeService calls
    *   Handle selector lookup using SelectorMap and highlight indices
    *   Implement error handling for action execution failures

3.  **Task 8 (Integration):** Complete `ScenarioParserOrchestrator` integration of all components
    *   Orchestrate the complete workflow: DOM capture ‚Üí prompt building ‚Üí LLM translation ‚Üí action execution
    *   Implement state management and error recovery
    *   Create final TestStep objects from successful operations

4.  **Documentation Maintenance:** Establish process to keep memory bank synchronized with implementation progress

## Active Decisions

*   **LLM Provider Strategy:** Support multiple providers but focus initial validation on OpenAI for reliability
*   **Validation Approach:** Real API testing with controlled test scenarios before integration with downstream components
*   **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error capture and reporting for debugging and self-correction capabilities
*   **Performance Optimization:** Balance DOM detail with prompt token efficiency for cost-effective LLM operations
