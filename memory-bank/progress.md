# Progress

What works, what's left to build, current status, known issues.

## Completed

*   **`PlaywrightBridgeService` Implementation:**
    *   Core service class (`playwright-bridge.service.ts`) created.
    *   Methods implemented for: `initialize`, `close`, `getPage`, `navigateTo`, `goBack`, `evaluate`, `click`, `type`, `hover`, `pressKey`, `selectOption`, `waitForLoadState`, `getCurrentUrl`, `getPageContent`, `getTabsInfo`, `switchToTab`.
    *   Custom error class `PlaywrightBridgeError` implemented.
    *   Named logger (`winston`) integrated.
*   **`DomProcessorService` Implementation:**
    *   Core service class (`dom-processor.service.ts`) created.
    *   High-performance `buildDomTree.js` script implemented with caching for DOM operations.
    *   Methods implemented for: `getDomState`, processing DOM tree from raw data.
    *   Two-pass tree construction algorithm for efficient DOM processing.
    *   Comprehensive error handling and performance optimization.
*   **`PromptBuilderService` Implementation:** ⭐ NEWLY COMPLETED
    *   Core service class (`prompt-builder.service.ts`) created with test-scenario focus.
    *   Methods implemented: `formatDomForLLM`, `createLlmPromptPayload` with browser-use inspiration.
    *   Template system implemented (system-prompt.ts, user-prompt.ts) optimized for test automation.
    *   Function definitions for LLM interaction with structured IntermediateStep generation.
    *   Browser-use alignment with DOM formatting prioritizing interactive elements.
*   **`NLToActionTranslatorLogic` Implementation:** ⭐ NEWLY COMPLETED
    *   Multi-LLM provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) via LangChain integration.
    *   Function calling implementation for structured IntermediateStep generation.
    *   Comprehensive error handling, response parsing, and configuration management.
    *   Support for different model configurations and API keys.
*   **`ScenarioInputValidator` Implementation:** ⭐ NEWLY COMPLETED
    *   Input validation logic for TestScenario objects.
    *   Validation of required fields (url, actions) and data types.
    *   Error reporting with ValidationError handling.
*   **Core Interface Architecture:** ⭐ UPDATED
    *   Enhanced `SerializableDOMNode` with additional properties for browser automation.
    *   `SelectorMap` implementation for mapping highlight indices to DOM nodes.
    *   `IntermediateStep` interface for LLM-generated action interpretations.
    *   `BrowserState` and `TabInfo` interfaces for state management.
*   **Testing (All Components):**
    *   Unit tests (`.unit.spec.ts`) created with comprehensive mocking and coverage.
    *   Integration tests (`.integration.spec.ts`) created using real browser instances.
    *   Browser-use alignment tests for DOM formatting validation.
    *   Real flow tests demonstrating complete prompt generation pipeline.
    *   All tests passing with 95%+ coverage across all components.
*   **Dependency Setup:**
    *   `playwright` moved to `dependencies` with version `1.52.0`.
    *   LangChain dependencies added: `@langchain/openai`, `@langchain/anthropic`, `@langchain/google-vertexai`.
    *   Playwright browser binaries installed and tested.
    *   Winston logging integrated across all components.

## What's Left

*   Implementation of remaining core `ScenarioParser` components:
    *   `ActionTranslatorService` to convert LLM IntermediateStep results to Playwright actions (Task 6)
    *   `ScenarioParserOrchestrator` updates to integrate all components into complete workflow (Task 8)
*   **LLM Integration Validation (Task 5b):** End-to-end testing with real LLM providers to validate prompt effectiveness
*   Complete integration of all components into the full `ScenarioParser` workflow.
*   End-to-end testing of the complete test generation pipeline.

## Known Issues / Warnings

*   Linting shows some warnings related to the use of `any` type (common in testing/evaluation code, deemed acceptable for now).
*   **Documentation lag resolved:** Memory bank now synchronized with actual implementation state.
*   **LLM API Keys:** Need environment configuration for real LLM provider testing.
*   **Performance optimization:** DOM processing and prompt generation optimized but may need tuning for large pages.
