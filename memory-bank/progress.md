# Progress

What works, what's left to build, current status, known issues.

## Completed

*   **`PlaywrightBridgeService` Implementation:**
    *   Core service class (`playwright-bridge.service.ts`) created.
    *   Methods implemented for: `initialize`, `close`, `getPage`, `navigateTo`, `goBack`, `evaluate`, `click`, `type`, `hover`, `pressKey`, `selectOption`, `waitForLoadState`, `getCurrentUrl`, `getPageContent`, `getTabsInfo`, `switchToTab`.
    *   Custom error class `PlaywrightBridgeError` implemented.
    *   Named logger (`winston`) integrated.
*   **`DomProcessorService` Implementation:**
    *   Core service class (`dom-processor.service.ts`) created.
    *   High-performance `buildDomTree.js` script implemented with caching for DOM operations.
    *   Methods implemented for: `getDomState`, processing DOM tree from raw data.
    *   Two-pass tree construction algorithm for efficient DOM processing.
    *   Comprehensive error handling and performance optimization.
*   **Testing (`PlaywrightBridgeService`):**
    *   Unit tests (`.unit.spec.ts`) created with mocking, covering core functionality and error handling. All passing.
    *   Integration tests (`.integration.spec.ts`) created using real browser instances (Chromium), covering navigation, clicks, typing, history, and waits. All passing (tested in both headless and headed modes).
*   **Testing (`DomProcessorService`):**
    *   Unit tests (`.unit.spec.ts`) created for DOM tree processing logic.
    *   Integration tests (`.integration.spec.ts`) created for Playwright interactions, covering DOM state capture and processing.
*   **Dependency Setup:**
    *   `playwright` moved to `dependencies`.
    *   `playwright` and `@playwright/test` aligned to version `1.52.0`.
    *   Playwright browser binaries installed.
*   **Linting:** Codebase linted, known warnings identified.

## What's Left

*   Implementation of other core `ScenarioParser` components:
    *   `PromptBuilderService` to format DOM for LLM
    *   `ActionTranslatorService` to convert LLM results to Playwright actions
    *   `ScenarioParserOrchestrator` updates to use the new components
*   Integration of the `PlaywrightBridgeService` and `DomProcessorService` into the `ScenarioParserOrchestrator`.
*   End-to-end testing of the complete `ScenarioParser` flow.

## Known Issues / Warnings

*   Linting shows some warnings related to the use of `any` type (common in testing/evaluation code, deemed acceptable for now) in:
    *   `playwright-bridge.service.ts`
    *   `dom-processor.service.ts` 
    *   Test files
