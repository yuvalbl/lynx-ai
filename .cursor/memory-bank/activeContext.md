## Current Focus

- **Current Task:** Phase 2: Planning & Implementation
- **Specifically:** Moving to Task 4: Implement DOM Processor Service.
- **Completed Task:** Task 3: Implement Playwright Bridge Service.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented `PlaywrightBridgeService` with methods for browser control, interaction, and state retrieval.
- Added unit and integration tests for `PlaywrightBridgeService`.
- Resolved linting issues and path mapping problems.
- Updated `tasks.md` to mark Task 3 as done.

## Next Steps

1.  Begin implementing Task 4: `DomProcessorService`.
    - Load `buildDomTree.js`.
    - Use `PlaywrightBridgeService.evaluate` to execute the script.
    - Parse the resulting JSON.
    - Build the `SerializableDOMNode` tree and `SelectorMap`.
2.  Write unit and integration tests for `DomProcessorService`.

## Active Decisions / Considerations

- The `evaluate` method in `PlaywrightBridgeService` uses an `any` cast due to type mismatches with Playwright's specific `PageFunction` expectations. This is documented with a comment.
- Ensure `buildDomTree.js` is correctly placed and read by the `DomProcessorService`.
