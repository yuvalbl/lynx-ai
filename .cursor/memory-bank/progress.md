## What Works

- **Task 1:** Module structure and core interfaces are defined.
- **Task 2:** Scenario input validation logic (`validateScenarioLogic`) is implemented and tested.
- **Task 3:** `PlaywrightBridgeService` is implemented and tested (unit & integration), capable of managing Playwright browser interactions.

## What's Left to Build

- **Task 4:** `DomProcessorService` (DOM capture and processing).
- **Task 5:** LLM Interaction (Prompt Building & Translation).
- **Task 6:** `ActionTranslatorService` (Mapping LLM steps to Playwright actions).
- **Task 7:** `TestStep` Creation logic.
- **Task 8:** `ScenarioParserOrchestrator` (Overall workflow management).
- **Task 9:** Comprehensive Integration and E2E Testing.

## Current Status

- Core browser interaction layer (`PlaywrightBridgeService`) is complete.
- Ready to proceed with DOM capture and processing (`DomProcessorService`).

## Known Issues

- The `evaluate` method in `PlaywrightBridgeService` uses an `any` cast for type compatibility with Playwright's internal types.
